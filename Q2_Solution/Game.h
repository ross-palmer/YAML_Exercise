	/// @brief the main game loop.
	/// 
	/// A complete loop involves processing SFML events, updating and drawing all game objects.
	/// The actual elapsed time for a single game loop results (lag) is stored. If this value is 
	///  greater than the notional time for one loop (MS_PER_UPDATE), then additional updates will be 
	///  performed until the lag is less than the notional time for one loop.
	/// The target is one update and one render cycle per game loop, but slower PCs may 
	///  perform more update than render operations in one loop.
	/// </summary>
